```

$ dominosjp
```
and follow the instructions

### Features

- Order a pizza in less than a minute
- Finds the best coupon for your order from your coupon box, by calculating the real value

### Limitations/TODO

(Prefixed by a difficulty estimation from 1 to 5)

- (1) Allow for paying via cash (credit card-only now)
- (5) Allow for selecting pizza toppings
- (4) Allow for selecting pizza size/cut type/number of slices
- (2) Allow for selecting sides (not only pizzas), (5) maybe even the special menu
- (5) Extra: Pizza Tracking via the CLI, and hopefully automate the Mystery Deal
